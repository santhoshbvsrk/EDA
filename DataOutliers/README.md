The explanation part of What are Outliers, Methods to Detect Outliers & Methods to Handle Outliers is available [here](https://github.com/santhoshbvsrk/EDA-Python/blob/main/DataOutliers/Outlier%20Detection%20&%20Handling.pptx)

Code for explaining Outlier Detection & Handling is available [here](https://github.com/santhoshbvsrk/EDA-Python/blob/main/DataOutliers/DataOutliers.ipynb)

The entire coding is done on Facebook dataset which is available [here](https://github.com/santhoshbvsrk/EDA-Python/blob/main/Facebook_EDA/facebook_data.csv)
