This Project provides the different packages Python provides to perform Exploratory Data Analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis takes the major portion of time(approximately 60%-70% of time). So, python has come up with few packages which perform Exploratory Data Analysis
by showing the outliers, missing data fields, data types of fields, plots graphs for different variables, shows correlation between different variables, etc.,

The packages which we'll be discussing here are 
  1. Pandas Profiling
  2. SweetViz
  3. AutoViz
  4. D-TALE
  5. PandasVisualAnalysis
  6. DataPrepEDA
 
 
 Provided notebooks as well which has the commands to explain how to use these Python provided packages.
