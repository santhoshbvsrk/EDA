This project is created as part of my learning and sharing knowledge.

In this project I've tried to explain What is Categorical Encoding ? Need to perform Categorical Encoding & the different methods in which Categorical Encoding can be performed and slightly touched upon drawbacks of few methods.

The explanation part of What Categorical Encoding, need of it & the methods to perform it is available [here](https://github.com/santhoshbvsrk/EDA-Python/blob/main/CategoricalEncoding/Categorical%20Encoding.pptx)

Code explaining how to perform various Categorical Encoding methods is available [here](https://github.com/santhoshbvsrk/EDA-Python/blob/main/CategoricalEncoding/CategoricalEncoding.ipynb)

The entire coding is done on AB_NYC_2019 dataset which is available [here](https://github.com/santhoshbvsrk/EDA-Python/blob/main/CategoricalEncoding/AB_NYC_2019.txt)
