#Pandas Visual Analysis
This package generates interactive visual graphs which you can plot by just selecting the columns for x & y axis.
You can also draw univariate graphs in this.
You can find all the statistical data for a field by selecting a field and the statistical value you want to determine.
You can normalize data for a specific field by choosing the field and check normlization flag.
This widget also has a facility called Aditive & Subtractive. Using this feature you can select multiple points on the plot and either delete or add 
if you feel those are outliers and see the change in graph (histogram) if skewness is fine and if outliers are removed.
