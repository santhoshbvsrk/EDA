This is my first project on EDA which is created as part of learning.

In this project I've tried to explain the steps to be performed in EDA on Facebook Dataset using Pandas Profiling & Visualization Tools using different Univariate & Bivariate graphs.

The explanation part of What I've done as part of Exploratory Data Analysis is available [here](https://github.com/santhoshbvsrk/EDA-Python/blob/main/Facebook_EDA/santhoshkumar.bvsrk@gmail.com_Term1_Project.pptx)

Code explaining how to perform EDA is available [here](https://github.com/santhoshbvsrk/EDA-Python/blob/main/Facebook_EDA/EDA-Facebook-Dataset-SanthoshKumarBVSRK.ipynb)

The entire coding is done on Facebook dataset which is available [here](https://github.com/santhoshbvsrk/EDA-Python/blob/main/Facebook_EDA/facebook_data.csv)
